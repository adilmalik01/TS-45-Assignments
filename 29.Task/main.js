//  independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is
// in your array. If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement,
//  such as You really like bananas!
